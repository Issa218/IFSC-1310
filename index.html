  <h2>Progressive Enhancement</h2>
 <p>Progressive enhancement is the concept of making sure that the content of a website is what all users can access no matter the browser or device. What makes it different from graceful degradation is the effect it has on workflow. Progressive enhancement centers around the content of a web page since content is the main reason websites are created and used. 
In progressive enhancement the structure of a page is content out meaning content is the center of structure of what we do. The example used in the article is a peanut M&M so in this context the peanut is the content and the chocolate part is the presentation or CSS and the outer shell is the javascript.
Some principles of progressive enhancement are using global web standards to make sure all the functions and capabilities of a website work on all browsers. Another is following the semantic HTML format that makes sure that if a user of the website can’t see the video or picture they can at least see some text explaining what it is. 
Lastly using an external CSS so that it can allow for basic layout of the content so that it is more presentable to the user. These principles ensure that if anything is blocked on a browser the user can still have the basic access to the content. This will allow the website to have better accessibility, compatibility and even speed.</p>

   <h2>Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
  <p>I showed the draft version of this project to my roommate and she gave me a couple of points to fix. The first was to change or get rid of the white shadow in the site title because it can be hard to read if my website was used on a phone. Another point of feedback was to change the email tag in the footer to something else like report an issue or feedback since naming it email wouldn’t encourage or help people understand what it is there for.She also told me to darken the body text a little bit more so it will have better contrast with the light background.
     She also said to get rid of the link to the top of the box titles. I thoroughly enjoyed working on this project and it taught me a lot. I feel like my skills have definitely improved by making this. I learned so much this semester and enjoyed all the content we were taught. I think that I did pretty well on the CSS part of this project but I still need to improve on my tags because I mess those up sometimes. One thing I could’ve done better is to not procrastinate this project since I started working on it later than I wanted to and make sure to push my stuff in github. 
     Overall I took all the feedback my roommate gave me and I fixed my project I also changed the font because I felt likt the thin one was a bit hard on the eyes after looking at it for a while.</p>
