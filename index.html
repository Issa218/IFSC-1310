  <h2>Progressive Enhancement</h2>
 <p>Progressive enhancement is the concept of making sure that the content of a website is what all users can access no matter the browser or device. What makes it different from graceful degradation is the effect it has on workflow. Progressive enhancement centers around the content of a web page since content is the main reason websites are created and used. 
In progressive enhancement the structure of a page is content out meaning content is the center of structure of what we do. The example used in the article is a peanut M&M so in this context the peanut is the content and the chocolate part is the presentation or CSS and the outer shell is the javascript.
Some principles of progressive enhancement are using global web standards to make sure all the functions and capabilities of a website work on all browsers. Another is following the semantic HTML format that makes sure that if a user of the website canâ€™t see the video or picture they can at least see some text explaining what it is. 
Lastly using an external CSS so that it can allow for basic layout of the content so that it is more presentable to the user. These principles ensure that if anything is blocked on a browser the user can still have the basic access to the content. This will allow the website to have better accessibility, compatibility and even speed.</p>
